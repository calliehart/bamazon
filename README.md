Once you have chosen an item it asks for a quantity. If that quantity is available, it shows you the total cost of the transaction and updates the table to reflect the new quantities available. 

Prompts:

* To purchase, enter ITEM ID:
* Enter desired QUANTITY:

## Problem:

- If desired quanity is not available inform user
- If desired quanity is available return the total cost of the users purchase
- Update the table to reflect stock quantity changes
